Add Pic Form:

-Both fields are required
-No need to check whether it's a real URL
-Send button activates only when something is filled in

---

no need to (because we validate front-end side): If description field is empty: we add Picture by User. Either front-end or back-end before saving to database

if url doesnt work (probably need to check on backend, we show a standard image)
